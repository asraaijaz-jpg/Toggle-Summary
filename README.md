Concept o f Toggl : 
 
The concept is simple: you use the Toggl timer to keep track of your tasks. Tasks can be categorized by project, and projects can be assigned to clients. You can also add tags to each task. If I wanted to I could tag that as “home” or “diner” so that later I could filter by where I worked. It’s very flexible. And on top of all of that, you can set up multiple workspaces, say one for home and one for work. Time tracking with Toggl has allowed me to take an objective look at my work week and spend more time on my most important business tasks.

Ways of Time Tracking: 
 
As I said earlier, you really have two options when it comes to tracking time with Toggl 

 
 
 
 
 Manual entries  Tracked time 
 
 
Work Area : 
 
Now, regardless of which way you go with this, it's always a good idea to store your entries under the right buckets — or what Toggl refers to as "Projects". 
• 
Workspace: Aside from your account itself, this is the top-most level and everything else sits inside of this "bucket". 
• 
Project: Projects are created within a Workspace, and you can have multiple projects within a given Workspace. 
• 
Client: Clients are attributed to projects, and while you can only assign one client to a project, you can create multiple projects for the same client. 
 
 
Reporting Features: 
 
Despite being a self-proclaimed "time tracking" software, Toggl is actually a reporting tool at heart. If you think about it, we have time trackers installed on every device we own. It's nothing new. What 

 
 
 
 
you get with Toggl is a way to PRESENT that information in a manner that makes sense for everyone involved. The section highlighted red is where you filter down by team, client, project or even tags and billable time. This is viewable by both the client and the freelancer, so it's incredibly useful on both sides. Granted, it's a pretty simple/basic interface, but that's exactly what you want with something like this. There's also an option to get a slightly deeper report which breaks down the exact tasks that were worked on, based on the task description.
